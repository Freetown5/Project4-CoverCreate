A cover letter template creater that allows the user (normally a job seeker, redundant I know) to create a template for cover letters, possibly thank you notes as well (still can't let this go), that they can save and reuse later. They will be able to use these templates by adding company relavant information to open spots in the template madlib style which they can automatially send via email to the recipeient they wish to receieve it. 

or (still mulling it over)
